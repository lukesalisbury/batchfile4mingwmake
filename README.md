These are not a replacement for the real programs, but they help me avoid needing msys when building software on windows


mkdir.cmd
Ignores -p argument and passes the argument to builtin mkdir

rm.cmd
redirects to del

tr.cmd
Not a replacement for tr, just uppercase the string if first arg is 'a-z' or lowercase if 'A-Z'

uname.cmd
IF argument -m is passed, x86_64 is return otherwise it will print Windows
